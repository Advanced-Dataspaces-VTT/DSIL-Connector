## Configuration Management

Configuration management is a critical aspect of software development, as it helps ensure that changes to the software are made in a controlled and predictable manner. The VTT connector follows strong configuration management practices to ensure that it can be developed, tested, and deployed in a secure and controlled manner.

The VTT connector uses Git as its version control system (VCS), with a protected main branch that requires two reviewers to approve changes before they can be merged. This helps ensure that changes are reviewed and tested before being deployed to production, which can help reduce the risk of issues that arise due to untested changes.

In addition to Git, the VTT connector uses Docker containers for packaging and deployment. Docker containers provide a consistent environment across development, testing, and production environments, which can help reduce the risk of issues that arise due to differences in environments. The VTT connector uses Docker Hub to manage containers and tags to manage different versions of the connector.

The VTT connector also follows IDSA standards and practices closely, which can help ensure that it is interoperable with other IDSA-compliant systems. Adhering to these standards helps increase the confidence of stakeholders in the connector and can help increase adoption of the connector within the IDSA ecosystem.

Finally, the VTT connector creates release notes for each production release, which includes information about new features, bug fixes and changes to the VTT connector.

## Production Support Procedures

Production support procedures refer to the processes and activities involved in maintaining the VTT connector after it has been deployed to production. These procedures are designed to ensure that the connector continues to function correctly and to address any issues or incidents that may arise in the production environment. Some common production support procedures include:

* Incident Management: Incident management is the process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving incidents that occur in the production environment. This may involve monitoring the connector for issues, identifying the cause of the issue, and taking steps to resolve it as quickly as possible.

* Change Management: Change management refers to the process of managing changes to the production environment. This may involve reviewing and approving changes to the connector, testing those changes before deployment, and monitoring the impact of those changes once they are deployed.

* Monitoring and Logging: Monitoring and logging are critical for production support, as they allow you to track the performance and behavior of the connector in the production environment. This may involve monitoring system metrics, application logs, and other performance indicators to identify potential issues and address them before they cause problems.

* Backup and Recovery: Backup and recovery procedures are critical for ensuring that the connector can be restored to a functioning state if disaster strikes.

### Incident Management

VTT has established incident management procedures to address any issues or incidents that may arise in the production environment.
